4. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Problem:

Given a string, return the length of the longest substring that has no repeated characters.

Example:

Input → "abcabcbb"
Output → 3
(The longest substring is "abc")

Input → "bbbbb"
Output → 1

Input → "pwwkew"
Output → 3
("wke")

❓ Your Task:

Explain the logic OR write JavaScript code for the optimal sliding window solution (O(n)).

🧩 Hint (optional):

Use two pointers left and right

Track seen characters using a Set or Map

Expand right pointer until duplicate appears

When duplicate appears → move left pointer and remove characters
